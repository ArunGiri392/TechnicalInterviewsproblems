This Repo contains some of the most asked technical interview questions.
This repo is inspired by Neetcode 150 and i have tried to keep all the problems for Neetcode 150.
You will find folder for each topic,and eahc topic consists of file name -- with problems name.
for example: if you go to, Twopointer folder, it means, this folder consists of all the problems that can be done by two pointers. and if you see any file, for ex: threesum.py meaning, this file contains the soultion of three sum problem.
