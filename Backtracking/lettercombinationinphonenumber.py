# Time complexity - - o(N * 4^n)
# There are some number which has 4 letter.
# in worst case, we could number like 9999--
# and at each position we have 4 choices. so 4^n.


# Total Work Done: At each level of the tree, we're doing work proportional to the length of the string at that point. Across all levels, this results in a total work of 

# part comes from the total number of nodes in the recursion tree, considering the branching factor of 4.
# The

# N part is due to the work done at each node, which is proportional to the length of the string being constructed.
